# dealcollector-frontend

### **WIP**

This is a personal [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project built to list and search through the weekly deals of my local supermarkets ([details on how I gathered the deals here](https://github.com/mathiswi/dealcollector)).


Built with [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).
